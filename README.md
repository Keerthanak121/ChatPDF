# ChatPDF
A Local LLM ChatPDF

In this Project, Using Ollama as the LLM server, Langchain and chroma as the RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation), and Streamlit as the user interface, a ChatPDF was created wherein we upload a PDF file and we can interact with a bot to get the specified response. 

After cloning the repository, type the following command to run Streamlit

streamlit run stream.py
